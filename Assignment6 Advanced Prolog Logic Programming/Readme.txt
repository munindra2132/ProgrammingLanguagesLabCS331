*  ==> Shortest Path on a maze with faultynode 
* Instructions to execute -
* 
* On Windows(GNU Prolog)
* 1) Change to the directory where the file is stored using the below command
*    ====>   change_directory('file directory').
* 2) Load the file using the below command
*    ====>   ['filename'].
* 3) To execute the loaded program write on the console 'interchange(X),shortest_path(src,dest,PATH).'
*    where  X  - list of nodes which have to interchange their faultyness
*           src - source node
*           dest - destination node
*    Ex - interchange([88]),shortest_path(11,99,P).
